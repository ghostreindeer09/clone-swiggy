# Swiggy Frontend Clone

A frontend clone of Swiggy — India’s popular food delivery platform — built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project showcases UI components and layout patterns inspired by Swiggy for learning and experimentation.

##  Features

- Responsive layout mimicking Swiggy’s homepage
- Interactive UI elements: restaurant cards, menu navigation, etc.
- Clean, modular structure using:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `index.js`

##  Demo

While there are no published releases, you can quickly launch the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ghostreindeer09/swiggy-frontend.git
cd swiggy-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the project (adjust if using a different serve method)
npx live-server
````

Then open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or whichever port your setup uses).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Install dependencies** with `npm install`
3. **Launch local server** using your preferred tool (e.g., `npx live-server`)
4. **Explore & customize**

## Project Structure

```
swiggy-frontend/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── styles.css        # Styling and responsive design
├── index.js          # JS logic and interactions
├── package.json      # Project metadata and dependencies
└── package-lock.json # Exact dependency versions
```

*Note: The `node_modules/` directory is present in the repo but typically should be ignored via `.gitignore`.*

## Scripts

Include in your `package.json`:

```jsonc
"scripts": {
  "start": "live-server",
  "build": "echo \"No build step defined yet\""
}
```

Adjust scripts as you incorporate more tools like bundlers or preprocessors.

## Future Enhancements

* Add UI frameworks (React, Vue, or Svelte)
* Integrate real or mock APIs for dynamic data
* Add routing for navigating between pages
* Implement responsive design improvements
* Add tests for components and interactions

## &#x20;Notes

* Node.js (v14+) is recommended.
* Consider adding `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules/`.
* No backend is currently integrated—this is purely frontend.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it’s enhancing layout, improving responsiveness, or adding interactivity, feel free to open issues or pull requests.
